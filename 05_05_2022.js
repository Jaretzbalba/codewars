// 6 kyu: Tribonacci Sequence
// As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. And, worse part of it, regrettably I won't get to hear non-native Italian speakers trying to pronounce it :(

//     So, if we are to start our Tribonacci sequence with [1, 1, 1] as a starting input (AKA signature), we have this sequence:

//     [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]

function tribonacci(signature, n) {
  for (var i = 0; i < n - 3; i++) {
    // iterate n times
    signature.push(signature[i] + signature[i + 1] + signature[i + 2]); // add last 3 array items and push to trib
  }
  return signature.slice(0, n); //return trib - length of n
}
