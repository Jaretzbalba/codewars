// 6 kyu: Two Sum
// Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

// For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

// The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

// twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]

function twoSum(numbers, target) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
      if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] === target) return [i, j];
    }
  }
}

// 6 kyu: Mexican Wave
// The wave (known as the Mexican wave in the English-speaking world outside North America) is an example of metachronal rhythm achieved in a packed stadium when successive groups of spectators briefly stand, yell, and raise their arms. Immediately upon stretching to full height, the spectator returns to the usual seated position.

// The result is a wave of standing spectators that travels through the crowd, even though individual spectators never move away from their seats. In many large arenas the crowd is seated in a contiguous circuit all the way around the sport field, and so the wave is able to travel continuously around the arena; in discontiguous seating arrangements, the wave can instead reflect back and forth through the crowd. When the gap in seating is narrow, the wave can sometimes pass through it. Usually only one wave crest will be present at any given time in an arena, although simultaneous, counter-rotating waves have been produced. (Source Wikipedia)
// Task
// In this simple Kata your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Mexican Wave. You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an array where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.
// Rules
//  1.  The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.

//  2.  If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as if it was an empty seat
// Example
// wave("hello") => ["Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"]

function wave(str) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] !== ' ') {
      result.push(str.slice(0, i) + str[i].toUpperCase() + str.slice(i + 1));
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// 6 kyu: Take a Number And Sum Its Digits Raised To The Consecutive Powers And ....Â¡Eureka!!
// The number 89 is the first integer with more than one digit that fulfills the property partially introduced in the title of this kata. What's the use of saying "Eureka"? Because this sum gives the same number.

// In effect: 89 = 8^1 + 9^2

// The next number in having this property is 135.

// See this property again: 135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3

// We need a function to collect these numbers, that may receive two integers a, b that defines the range [a, b] (inclusive) and outputs a list of the sorted numbers in the range that fulfills the property described above.

// Let's see some cases (input -> output):

// 1, 10 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

// 1, 100 -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 89]
// If there are no numbers of this kind in the range [a, b] the function should output an empty list.

// 90, 100 --> []

function sumDigPow(a, b) {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
    let powerSum = i
      .toString()
      .split('')
      .reduce((a, b, index) => a + b ** (index + 1), 0);
    if (powerSum == i) {
      result.push(i);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
