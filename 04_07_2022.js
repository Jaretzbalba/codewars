// 8 kyu: Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List
// Your task is to make two functions (max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language) that receive a list of integers as input and return, respectively, the largest and lowest number in that list.

var min = function(list){
    return Math.min(...list)
}
  
  var max = function(list){
    return Math.max(...list)
}

// 8 kyu: Will you make it?
// You were camping with your friends far away from home, but when it's time to go back, you realize that your fuel is running out and the nearest pump is 50 miles away! You know that on average, your car runs on about 25 miles per gallon. There are 2 gallons left. Considering these factors, write a function that tells you if it is possible to get to the pump or not. Function should return true (1 in Prolog, NASM and COBOL) if it is possible and false (0 in Prolog, NASM and COBOL) if not. The input values are always positive.

const zeroFuel = (distanceToPump, mpg, fuelLeft) => {
    return fuelLeft * mpg >= distanceToPump ? true : false
};

// 8 kyu: Array plus array
// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    return arr1.concat(arr2).reduce((a,b) => a + b, 0)
}

// 8 kyu: Count the Monkeys!
// You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

// As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.

function monkeyCount(n) {
    let arr = []
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
      arr.push(i)
    }
    return arr
}

// 7 kyu: Remove the minimum
// The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

function removeSmallest(numbers) {
    let min = Math.min(...numbers);
    console.log(min)
    let smallestNumIndex = numbers.indexOf(min)
    console.log(smallestNumIndex)
    let newNumbers = numbers.slice(0)
    newNumbers.splice(smallestNumIndex,1)
    return newNumbers
