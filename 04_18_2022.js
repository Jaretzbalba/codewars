// 8 kyu: Beginner Series #4 Cockroach
// The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

function cockroachSpeed(s) {
    return Math.floor(s * 27.7778)
}

// 8 kyu: L1: Set Alarm
// Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.

// The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise.

function setAlarm(employed, vacation){
    return (employed === true && vacation === false ) ? true : false
}

// 7 kyu: Sort array by string length
// Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.

// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

// ["Telescopes", "Glasses", "Eyes", "Monocles"]

// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Eyes", "Glasses", "Monocles", "Telescopes"]

// All of the strings in the array passed to your function will be different lengths, so you will not have to decide how to order multiple strings of the same length.

function sortByLength (array) {
    return array.sort((a,b) => a.length - b.length)
};
