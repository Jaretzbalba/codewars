// 7 kyu: Find the stray number
// You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

// Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

// The input array will always be valid! (odd-length >= 3)

// Examples
// [1, 1, 2] ==> 2
// [17, 17, 3, 17, 17, 17, 17] ==> 3

function stray(numbers) {
  //sort array and compare index 0,1
  // if 0 === 1 return last index in array else return first index
  let sortedArr = numbers.sort();
  return sortedArr[0] === sortedArr[1] ? sortedArr[numbers.length - 1] : sortedArr[0];
}

// 7 kyu: Testing 1-2-3
// Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

// Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

// The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

// Examples: (Input --> Output)

// [] --> []
// ["a", "b", "c"] --> ["1: a", "2: b", "3: c"]

var number = function (array) {
  return array.map((e, i) => `${i + 1}: ${e}`);
};

// 7 kyu: Sort Numbers
// Finish the solution so that it sorts the passed in array of numbers. If the function passes in an empty array or null/nil value then it should return an empty array.

// For example:

// solution([1, 2, 10, 50, 5]); // should return [1,2,5,10,50]
// solution(null); // should return []

function solution(nums) {
  if (nums === null) return [];
  if (nums.length === 0) return [];
  return nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
}

// 7 kyu: Make a function that does arithmetic!
// Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

// a and b will both be positive integers, and a will always be the first number in the operation, and b always the second.

// The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

// A few examples:(Input1, Input2, Input3 --> Output)

// 5, 2, "add"      --> 7
// 5, 2, "subtract" --> 3
// 5, 2, "multiply" --> 10
// 5, 2, "divide"   --> 2.5

function arithmetic(a, b, operator) {
  switch (operator) {
    case 'add':
      return a + b;
    case 'subtract':
      return a - b;
    case 'multiply':
      return a * b;
    case 'divide':
      return a / b;
  }
}

// 7 kyu: Money, Money, Money
// Mr. Scrooge has a sum of money 'P' that he wants to invest. Before he does, he wants to know how many years 'Y' this sum 'P' has to be kept in the bank in order for it to amount to a desired sum of money 'D'.

// The sum is kept for 'Y' years in the bank where interest 'I' is paid yearly. After paying taxes 'T' for the year the new sum is re-invested.

// Note to Tax: not the invested principal is taxed, but only the year's accrued interest

// Example:

//   Let P be the Principal = 1000.00
//   Let I be the Interest Rate = 0.05
//   Let T be the Tax Rate = 0.18
//   Let D be the Desired Sum = 1100.00

// After 1st Year -->
//   P = 1041.00
// After 2nd Year -->
//   P = 1083.86
// After 3rd Year -->
//   P = 1128.30
// Thus Mr. Scrooge has to wait for 3 years for the initial principal to amount to the desired sum.

// Your task is to complete the method provided and return the number of years 'Y' as a whole in order for Mr. Scrooge to get the desired sum.

// Assumption: Assume that Desired Principal 'D' is always greater than the initial principal. However it is best to take into consideration that if Desired Principal 'D' is equal to Principal 'P' this should return 0 Years.

function calculateYears(principal, interest, tax, desired) {
  //initialize totalYears to keep track of years
  //while loop
  let totalYears = 0;
  while (principal < desired) {
    principal += principal * interest * (1 - tax);
    totalYears++;
  }
  return totalYears;
}
